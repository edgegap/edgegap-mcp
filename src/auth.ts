/**
 * Token acquisition.
 *
 * The developer is asked for their token at first use rather than having to
 * paste it into a client config file before anything works.
 *
 * WHERE THE TOKEN LIVES, EXHAUSTIVELY:
 *
 *   - one variable in this process's memory, for the life of this process
 *
 * That is the complete list. It is never written to disk, never sent to any
 * Edgegap-operated service, never logged, never included in a tool result, and
 * never persisted across restarts. The process runs on the developer's own
 * machine, spawned by their editor, and dies with it. Closing the editor is a
 * complete revocation of this server's access.
 *
 * This is the reason the server is distributed as a local stdio process rather
 * than hosted. A hosted version would put customer credentials in transit
 * through Edgegap infrastructure on every call, which is a different security
 * claim no matter how carefully the hosting is written.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — read before extending this file.
 *
 * The MCP specification says servers should not use elicitation to collect
 * sensitive data, and an API token is sensitive. This implementation exists
 * because the setup friction of a config-file token is the single largest drop
 * in the onboarding funnel, but it is a deliberate trade, not a default to copy.
 * The mitigations below are what make the trade defensible, and removing any of
 * them breaks it:
 *
 *   - the environment variable is always preferred when present
 *   - the token is held in memory only, for one process lifetime
 *   - the elicitation states the token's blast radius in plain language
 *   - the developer must tick an acknowledgement before the token is accepted
 *   - the token is stripped from every error string before it reaches the model
 *
 * The real fix is scoped, revocable, deploy-only credentials issued by Edgegap.
 * Until those exist, this file is a workaround and should be labelled as one.
